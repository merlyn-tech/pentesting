# Linux Fundamentals

#### Kernel

* The kernel of the operating system is like an air traffic controller at an airport, and the applications are the airplanes under its control.

* The kernel decides which program gets which blocks of memory, it starts and kills applications, and it handles displaying text or graphics on a monitor.

#### Debian Package Management

Use software packages distributed as files ending in `.deb`
`dpkg` - lowest-level tool for managing .deb files

`apt-get` - Advanced Package Tool (front end program to `dpkg` tool)


#### RPM Package Management

According to the Linux Standards Base, the standard package management system is RPM (recursive acronym, the RPM Package Manager).

Uses .rpm files for each software package. The RPM Package Management systems track dependencies between packages. Tracking dependencies ensures that when a package is installed, the system also installs any packages needed by that package to function correctly. Dependencies also ensure that software updates and removals are performed properly.

`rpm` - lowest-level tool for RPM Package Management
`yum` or `up2date` - front-end tools that automate the process of resolving dependency issues.
