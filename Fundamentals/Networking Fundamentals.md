# **Networking Fundamentals**

## **DNS**

* Domain Name System
* TLD (Top level domain) (e.g. `.com`)
  * ccTLD = Country Code TLD
* Second-level domain (e.g. `tryhackme.com`)
* Subdomains (e.g. `admin.tryhackme.com`)

### _Record Types_

* A Record -- Resolve to IPv4 addresses
* AAAA Record -- Resolve to IPv6 addresses
* CNAME Record -- Resolve to another domain name
* MX Record -- resolve to the address of the servers that handle the email for the domain you are querying
* TXT Record -- free text fields where any text-based data can be stored.

Types of DNS Server

* Recursive DNS Server
* Root DNS Server
* Authoritative DNS Server

Using nslookup

```shell
user@thm:~$ nslookup --type=CNAME shop.website.thm
Server: 127.0.0.53
Address: 127.0.0.53#53

Non-authoritative answer:
shop.website.thm canonical name = shops.myshopify.com

user@thm:~$ nslookup --type=TXT website.thm
Server: 127.0.0.53
Address: 127.0.0.53#53

Non-authoritative answer:
website.thm text = "THM{7012BBA60997F35A9516C2E16D2944FF}"
```

## HTTP
Hypertext Transfer Protocol

### GET Method

#### Example Request
```shell
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: tryhackme.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 Firefox/87.0
Referer: https://tryhackme.com/

```

Breakdown:
* **Line 1:** This request is sending the GET method ( more on this in the HTTP Methods task ), request the home page with / and telling the web server we are using HTTP protocol version 1.1.
  
* **Line 2:** We tell the web server we want the website tryhackme.com
  
* Line 3: We tell the web server we are using the Firefox version 87 Browser
  
* **Line 4:** We are telling the web server that the web page that referred us to this one is https://tryhackme.com
  
* **Line 5:** HTTP requests always end with a blank line to inform the web server that the request has finished.

#### Example Response:
```shell
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.15.8
Date: Fri, 09 Apr 2021 13:34:03 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 98

<html>
<head>
    <title>TryHackMe</title>
</head>
<body>
    Welcome To TryHackMe.com
</body>
</html>

```
Breakdown:
* **Line 1:** HTTP 1.1 is the version of the HTTP protocol the server is using and then followed by the HTTP Status Code in this case "200 Ok" which tells us the request has completed successfully.
  
* **Line 2:** This tells us the web server software and version number.

* **Line 3:** The current date, time and timezone of the web server.

* **Line 4:** The Content-Type header tells the client what sort of information is going to be sent, such as HTML, images, videos, pdf, XML.

* **Line 5:** Content-Length tells the client how long the response is, this way we can confirm no data is missing.

* **Line 6:** HTTP response contains a blank line to confirm the end of the HTTP response.

* **Lines 7-14:** The information that has been requested, in this instance the homepage.
