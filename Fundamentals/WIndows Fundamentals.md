# Windows Fundamentals

#### Windows File System

New Technology File System (NTFS)
In case of a failure, the file system can automatically repair the folders/files on disk using information stored in a log file. This function is not possible with FAT.

NTFS addresses many of the limitations of the previous file systems; such as: 

* Supports files larger than 4GB
* Set specific permissions on folders and files
* Folder and file compression
* Encryption (Encryption File System or EFS)

Before NTFS, there was FAT16/32 (File Allocation Table), and HPFS (High Performance File System).

Another feature of NTFS is Alternate Data Streams (ADS).

* Is a file attribute specific to Windows NTFS (New Technology File System).
* Every file has at least one data stream ($DATA)
* ADS allows files to contain more than one stream of data.
* Natively Window Explorer doesn't display ADS to the user.
* There are 3rd party executables that can be used to view this data, but Powershell gives you the ability to view ADS for files.
* From a security perspective, malware writers have used ADS to hide data.

System Environment Variable for Windows Directory = `windir`
Local User and Group Management -> type in `lusrmgr.msc` into Run. 

#### User Account Control (UAC)

Note: UAC (by default) doesn't apply for the built-in local administrator account. 

* When a user with an account type of administrator logs into a system, the current session doesn't run with elevated permissions.
* When an operation requiring higher-level privileges needs to execute, the user will be prompted to confirm if they permit the operation to run. 

System Configuration Utility = `msconfig`
* Is for advanced troubleshooting, and its main purpose is to help diagnose startup issues. 

Open Control Panel = Run `control.exe`
Open User Account Control Settings = Run `UserAccountControlSettings.exe`
Open Computer Management Utility = Run `compmgmt.msc`
Open System Information = `msinfo32.exe`
Open Resource Monitor = `resmon.exe`
Open Registry Editor = `regedt32.exe` or `regedit`


#### Windows Command Prompt

```shell
# Output computer name
hostname

# Output name of logged-in user
whoami

# Show the network address settings for the computer.
ipconfig

# Retrieve help for a command
/?
e.g. ipconfig /?

# Clear Command Prompt Screen
cls

# Display protocol statistics and current TCP/IP network connections. 
netstat

# Manage network Resources (note /? won't work in this case, use help instead)
net
net help
