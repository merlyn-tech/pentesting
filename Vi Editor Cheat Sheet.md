# VI Editor Cheat Sheet
Author: Bharat Patel

### Commands

3 modes used in `vi`:
* Command Mode
* Insert Mode
* Ex Mode

### Command Mode

Used to type commands (e.g. move around a doc), manipulate text, and access the other two modes.

```shell
# Return to Command Mode
Esc key

# Motion
[count]motion

e.g. 5h = Move cursor five characters to the left.

Motions
| Motion | Result              |
|--------|---------------------|
| h      | Left one character  |
| j      | Down one line       |
| k      | Up one line         |
| l      | Right one character |
| w      | One word forward    |
| b      | One word back       |
| ^      | Beginning of line   |
| $      | End of the line     |


# Together, it is:

action[count]motion
[count]actionmotion

# Actions

# Delete - removes the indicated text from the page and saves it into the buffer

| Action | Result                             |
|--------|------------------------------------|
| dd     | Delete current line                |
| 3dd    | Delete the next three lines        |
| dw     | Delete the current word            |
| d3w    | Delete the next three words        |
| d4h    | Delete four characters to the left |

# Change

Change is very similar to delete; the text is removed and saved into the buffer, however, the program is switched to insert mode to allow immediate changes to the text. 

| Action | Result                             |
|--------|------------------------------------|
| cc     | Change current line                |
| cw     | Change current word                |
| c3w    | Change the next three words        |
| c5h    | Change five characters to the left |

# Yank (Copy) - Places content into buffer without deleting

| Action | Result                      |
|--------|-----------------------------|
| yy     | Yank current line           |
| 3yy    | Yank the next three lines   |
| yw     | Yank the current word       |
| y$     | Yank to the end of the line |

# Put (Paste) - Put places the text saved in the buffer either before or after the cursor position. Notice that these are the only two options, put does not use the motions like the previous action commands.

| Action         | Result                   |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| p (lower case) | Put (paste) after cursor |
| P (UPPER CASE) | Put before cursor        |


```

### Searching in vi

```shell
# Search forward from current position
/[search term]
Enter key

# Search backward from current position
?[search term]
Enter key.

# Process to next match
n (lower case)

# Go back to previous match
N (UPPER CASE)
```

### Insert Mode

| Input | Purpose                                             |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| a     | Enter insert mode right after the cursor            |
| A     | Enter insert mode at the end of the line            |
| i     | Enter insert mode right before the cursor           |
| I     | Enter insert mode at the beginning of the line      |
| o     | Enter insert mode on a blank line after the cursor  |
| O     | Enter insert mode on a blank line before the cursor |
