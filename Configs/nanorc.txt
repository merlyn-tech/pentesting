The following has been tested using nano from a terminal in MS-Windows.
It will get your nano one step closer supporting the "universal" shortcuts for copy/cut/paste etc. (at least in the Windows world).
Add these lines to the file /etc/nanorc

bind ^c copytext main
bind ^x cut main
bind ^v uncut main
bind ^z undo main
bind ^y redo main
bind ^f whereis main
bind F3 findnext main
bind ^h replace main
set tabsize 4
set linenumbers
Be aware they work per whole-line if you don't select text first :-/

If you have issues selecting text in nano with shift+arrow-keys then be aware this doesn't seem to be related to nano but your terminal program! It doesn't work in PuTTY, but it does e.g. work in Kitty (a fork of PuTTY, Windows-version / Linux-version) or Google's SSH client for Chrome.

(I'm using Debian buster)
